                        <h2>Me, in a nutshell</h2>
                        <p><h3>Creative Lead – <span class="lead">I bring what it takes.</span></h3></p>
                        <h6>Creativity</h6>
                        <p>I'm a creative visionary, whose entire life was shaped by artistic works and ambitions and has consistently followed the same direction - true to the maxim "Thinking without limits, even on 10 square meters, that's my strength!" [Stromberg]</p>
                        <h6>Experience</h6>
                        <p>I have a strong 15 years background in visual design, problem-solving, and management while offering a wide range of essential hard and soft skills from all of these disciplines – and I never stop learning.</p>
                        <h6>Passion</h6>
                        <p>I'm passionate about creating beauty and value with my keen sense of aesthetics, attention to detail, and high personal quality and functionality standards. I'm passionate about leading and supervising teams and processes with my strong people-, organizational, and communication skills. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and inspiration with empathy, empowering people to achieve both personal and shared objectives.</p>
                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <h5>What I’m currently doing</h5>
                        <p><h3>Product Design  [~1.5 years]</h3></p>
                        <p>On top of my extensive expertise in [mainly print] Design, Team Lead, and Management, I'm currently broadening and deepening my knowledge in the fields of User Experience and User Interface Design. Aiming to bridge the gap between surface and interface, I'm learning various new digital skills and tools, gaining an even better understanding of the user-centered rather than customer-centered design thinking process, mobile-first approach, etc. For being able to expand my practice beyond German borders, I've opted for intensive English-speaking training programs with an expert tutor- and mentorship. I'm consistently creating new projects from scratch that practically incorporate all aspects of learning and am furthermore specializing in Frontend Development and Animation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>What I’ve done before</h5>
                        <p><h3>Art Direction [~15 years]</h3></p>
                        <p>As a long-time [Media Designer and] Art Director at a large full-service agency, I've developed extensive experience in the design industry, working with a wide range of small to global companies. I conceptualized, produced, and managed extensive creative communication concepts on the highest functional and visual levels. I transformed complex and technical issues into valuable solutions through critical thinking and clear communication to meet customer, user, and business goals. I led design teams of up to 10 people, coordinated interdisciplinary teams, and managed creative processes with a focus on compliance and deadlines. My conceptual strength, motivation, empathy, organizational skills, and customer focus have always helped me to successfully take my clients to their goals.</p>
                        <p><h3>Training Management [~12 years]</h3></p>
                        <p>In addition to my regular work as an Art Director, I took on responsibilities as (certified) Training Manager at the company. I was accountable for pedagogical and technical supervision as well as proper planning and implementation of the accredited dual apprenticeship "Media Designer Digital &amp; Print" and thus jointly responsible for numerous, continuously successful graduations. I mentored and managed trainee teams from recruiting process to exam preparation to resume writing and ensured optimal personal development while balancing the needs of all stakeholders. I also continually adapted training structures and processes to a growing business, turning them into a system independent from the parent company.</p>
                        <p><h3>Audit Committee Membership [~12 years]</h3></p>
                        <p>Beyond my position as Art Director and Training Manager, as a long-term honorary member of the IHK Nuremberg examination committee (Chamber of Commerce and Industry), I acquired in-depth knowledge in evaluating technical design exams for the "Media Designer Digital &amp; Print" apprenticeship. Ensuring to benefit both the committee and the company's trainees, I regularly participated in test analyses, provided responsible and well-founded feedback, and also collaborated on developing test criteria.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>What I do privately</h5>
                        <p><h3>Fine Art Design [~4 years]</h3></p>
                        <p>Inspired by my love for the graphic-technical design process as well as my strong passion for holistic aesthetics and the highest level of detail perfectionism, I  create artworks that excellently combine my enthusiasm for these disciplines - distributed under the self-branded label ARTIG &amp; FINE.</p>
